# PvP2.0
Simple and very useful (Kit)PvP-Plugin for Spigot


## Download
PvP2.0 could be downloaded from two "release-channels":

* Stable:
  * dev.bukkit.org: [http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/pvp/](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/pvp/)
  * spigotmc.org: [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pvp-2-0.2808/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pvp-2-0.2808/)
* Development:
  * jenkins.lukasberger.at: [http://jenkins.lukasberger.at/job/PvP 2.0/](http://jenkins.lukasberger.at/job/PvP 2.0/)

It's recommended to download stable-build only!
**I do not give	proper support to development-build**
